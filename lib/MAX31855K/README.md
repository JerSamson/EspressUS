This library is used for interfacing the *SparkFun MAX31855K Thermocouple Breakout* board.  The library is configured by default to interface the board on pins D10-A1 of a [3.3V Arduino Pro Mini](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11114).  The pins are configurable in the sketch, but this board runs at 3.3V. *Level shifting is needed if you are not using a 3.3V device to communicate with it*.
